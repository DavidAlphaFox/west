The application `WEST` implements a distributed Web Event-Driven System's Tool, based on WebSockets and Distributed Erlang. It allows applications communicate each other using a simple JSON-based protocol through the WebSockets API, breaking the traditional centralized model of MoM and ESB and implementing a P2P communication and integration system.
